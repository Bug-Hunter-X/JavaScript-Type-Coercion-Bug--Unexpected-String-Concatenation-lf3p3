This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in JavaScript related to type coercion. The `foo` function unexpectedly concatenates strings instead of performing numerical addition when one of the inputs is a string. The `bar` function provides a corrected solution by using `parseInt` to ensure both inputs are treated as numbers before the addition.  This highlights the need for careful type handling in JavaScript to avoid unexpected behavior.
